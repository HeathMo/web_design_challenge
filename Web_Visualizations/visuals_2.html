        <p>The above visualization plots the city latitude versus the 
            humidity at a specific time point. It is important to note that
            the negative latitudes correspond with the Southern Hemisphere and 
            the postive latitudes correspond to the Northern Hemisphere.  The 
            Equator is at latitude of zero.  There appears to be a line at 100
            which is due to the fact that humidity is measured in percentage
            so 100% is the maximum measurable level. The plot indicates that
            regardless of latitude, there is a fairly wide range of low to high
            humidity.
