        <p>The above visualization maps the city latitude versus the maximum
            temperature at a specific time point. It is important to note that
            the negative latitudes correspond with the Southern Hemisphere and 
            the postive latitudes correspond to the Northern Hemisphere.  The 
            Equator is denoted by a latitude of zero. This plot shows a trend of
            an increase in temperature the closer you move towards the Equator
            in either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.
