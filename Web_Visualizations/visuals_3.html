            The above visualization plots the city latitude versus the cloudiness
            at a specific point in time. It is important to note that
            the negative latitudes correspond with the Southern Hemisphere and 
            the postive latitudes correspond to the Northern Hemisphere.  The 
            Equator is at latitude of zero. Because cloudiness is measured as a 
            percentage, there are no data points below 0% or above 100%. The plot 
            indicates that regardless of latitude, there is a wide range of cloudiness.
