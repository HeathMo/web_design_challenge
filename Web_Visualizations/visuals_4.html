            The above visualization plots the city latitude versus the 
            wind speed at a specific point in time. It is important to note that
            the negative latitudes correspond with the Southern Hemisphere and 
            the postive latitudes correspond to the Northern Hemisphere.  The 
            Equator is at latitude of zero. The plot indicates that the majority 
            of the wind speeds are between 0 and 15 miles per hour. Regardless of 
            latitude, there is a trend towards the lower wind speeds but some 
            distribution. The highest wind speeds are towards the poles.
